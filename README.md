## What does n8n mean?

**Short answer:** It means "nodemation" and is pronounced as n-eight-n.

**Long answer:** "I get that question quite often (more often than I expected) so I decided it is probably best to answer it here. While looking for a good name for the project with a free domain I realized very quickly that all the good ones I could think of were already taken. So, in the end, I chose nodemation. 'node-' in the sense that it uses a Node-View and that it uses Node.js and '-mation' for 'automation' which is what the project is supposed to help with. However, I did not like how long the name was and I could not imagine writing something that long every time in the CLI. That is when I then ended up on 'n8n'." - **Jan Oberhauser, Founder and CEO, n8n.io**

## Running n8n with Docker using WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)

If you are on Windows and want to build and run your local n8n code with Docker, you can use WSL for a smooth experience. Here are the steps:

### 1. Open WSL from Command Prompt
- Open Command Prompt (cmd.exe)
- Type:
  ```sh
  wsl
  ```
- This will open your default WSL Linux shell.

### 2. Navigate to your project directory
- In WSL, run:
  ```sh
  cd /mnt/c/Data/Personal/Projects/20250717_N8N/n8n-atom
  ```

### 3. Install dependencies (if not already done)
- In WSL, run:
  ```sh
  curl -fsSL https://get.pnpm.io/install.sh | sh -
  export PATH="$HOME/.local/share/pnpm:$PATH"
  pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
  ```

### 4. Build the project and Docker image
- In WSL, run:
  ```sh
  node scripts/build-n8n.mjs
  docker build -t n8n-local -f docker/images/n8n/Dockerfile .
  ```

### 5. Start the container
- In WSL, run:
  ```sh
  docker volume create n8n_data  # Only needed once
  docker run -it --rm --name n8n -p 5678:5678 -v n8n_data:/home/node/.n8n n8n-local
  ```

### 6. Access n8n
- Open [http://localhost:5678](http://localhost:5678) in your browser.

**Note:**
- Make sure Docker Desktop is running and WSL integration is enabled.
- If you get `pnpm: not found`, install it as shown above.
